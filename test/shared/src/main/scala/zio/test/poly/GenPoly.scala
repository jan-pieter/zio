/**
 * `GenPoly` provides evidence that an instance of `Gen[T]` exists for some
 * concrete but unknown type `T`. Subtypes of `GenPoly` provide additional
 * constraints on the type of `T`, such as that an instance of `Ordering[T]` or
 * `Numeric[T]` exists. Users can also extend `GenPoly` to add their own
 * constraints.
 *
 * This allows construction of polymorphic generators where the the type is
 * known to satisfy certain constraints even though the type itself is unknown.
 *
 * For instance, consider the following generalized algebraic data type:
 *
 * {{{
 * sealed trait Expr[+A] extends Product with Serializable
 *
 * final case class Value[+A](value: A) extends Expr[A]
 * final case class Mapping[A, +B](expr: Expr[A], f: A => B) extends Expr[B]
 * }}}
 *
 * We would like to test that for any expression we can fuse two mappings. We
 * want to create instances of `Expr` that reflect the full range of values that
 * an `Expr` can take, including multiple layers of nested mappings and mappings
 * between different types.
 *
 * Since we do not need any constraints on the generated types we can simply use
 * `GenPoly`. `GenPoly` includes a convenient generator in its companion object,
 * `genPoly`, that generates instances of 40 different types including primitive
 * types and various collections.
 *
 * Using it we can define polymorphic generators for expressions:
 *
 * {{{
 * def genValue(t: GenPoly): Gen[Any, Expr[t.T]] =
 *   t.genT.map(Value(_))
 *
 * def genMapping(t: GenPoly): Gen[Any, Expr[t.T]] =
 *   Gen.suspend {
 *     GenPoly.genPoly.flatMap { t0 =>
 *       genExpr(t0).flatMap { expr =>
 *         val genFunction: Gen[Any, t0.T => t.T] = Gen.function(t.genT)
 *         val genExpr1: Gen[Any, Expr[t.T]]      = genFunction.map(f => Mapping(expr, f))
 *         genExpr1
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 * def genExpr(t: GenPoly): Gen[Any, Expr[t.T]] =
 *   Gen.oneOf(genMapping(t), genValue(t))
 * }}}
 *
 * Finally, we can test our property:
 *
 * {{{
 * test("map fusion") {
 *   check(GenPoly.genPoly.flatMap(genExpr(_))) { expr =>
 *     assert(eval(fuse(expr)))(equalTo(eval(expr)))
 *   }
 * }
 * }}}
 *
 * This will generate expressions with multiple levels of nesting and
 * polymorphic mappings between different types, making sure that the types line
 * up for each mapping. This provides a higher level of confidence in properties
 * than testing with a monomorphic value.
 *
 * Inspired by Erik Osheim's presentation "Galaxy Brain: type-dependence and
 * state-dependence in property-based testing"
 * [[http://plastic-idolatry.com/erik/oslo2019.pdf]].
